Summary :

 * Extending scopes of FAPI-SIG
   In the 35th meeting, it was determined that FAPI-SIG's scope is extended to attract more contributors and have them get involved in FAPI-SIG. 
   To determine how to extend FAPI-SIG's scope, there are several strategies: market driven (ex. Open Banking), standard driven, and both mixed.
   In the next meeting, the extended scope will be discussed and priotization will be also discussed.

 * Rename FAPI-SIG
   We consider renaming FAPI-SIG to match the aim of extended FAPI-SIG's scope appropriately.
   We will ask for the candidate of the new FAPI-SIG's name in keycloak-dev mailing list.
   In the next meeting, we will disucuss the new FAPI-SIG's name.
