 * New item : Open Banking Brasil
   keycloak development team itself deals with this support so that some coordination is needed if FAPI-SIG also helps with it.
    -> We can use the following JIRA ticket : https://issues.redhat.com/browse/KEYCLOAK-18629
    
   Keycloak has already satisfied some requirements by Open Banking Brasil. However, some requirements has not yet been satisfied by keycloak.

   PR sent to kc-sig-fapi to support automated conformance test run.
   https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-oauth-sig/pull/192
   -> Hopefully, someone add instructions (README.md might be appropriate) to run it.

 * Other Discussion Topics
   - Blocker for QWAC Verification in PSD2/eIDAS : how to control MTLS per endpoint
     It seems that wildfly only controls MTLS on whole application, not per endpoint.
     -> Need help to resolve this issue. Hopefully, someone could help with it.
