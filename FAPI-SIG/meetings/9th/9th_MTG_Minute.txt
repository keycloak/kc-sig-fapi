 * Other Topics
   - Proposal for meeting PSD2
     At first showing the analysis result of how CIBA fits PSD2 Berlin Group in the future FAPI-SIG meeting
   - Client Registration Policy coexists in RH-SSO 7.5
     The existing officially supported Client Registration Policy will be still officially supported in RH-SS0 7.5 because Client Policy that can replace Client Registration Policy will be released as the technology preview at first in the RH-SSO 7.5.
   - FAPI-RW Certificate
     Even if passing all FAPI-RW conformance tests requires activation of Client Policy as technology preview in RH-SSO, after clarifying the configuration needed to pass all FAPI-RW conformance tests, we need to discuss which product has to be certified, how to display being certified on the server, how to publish this result, and so on.
   - Meeting Schedule
     Next 6 Jan 2021 (10th), and biweekly as usual.
