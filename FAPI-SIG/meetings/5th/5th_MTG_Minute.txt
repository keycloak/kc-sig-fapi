 * Updates : Client Policy Official Support project
   It has been modified by considering New Admin REST API & Console UI support.
     - Only support New Admin Console. Not support the existing Admin Console.
     - Also support New Admin REST API (clear JSON Document)
     - Realizing FAPI-RW by only using Client Policies is optional task for the first milestone.
     - Skip Client Registration Policy migration to Client Policies.
   [Milestone]
   - At the end of Mar 2021 : All PRs merged needed to support
     * External Interfaces
      - New Admin REST API
      - New Admin Console UI
   [Issues]
    TBD
