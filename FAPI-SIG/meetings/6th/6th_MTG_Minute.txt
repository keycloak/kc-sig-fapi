   [Notes]
     - PR's review priority by keycloak development team affects this milestone.
     - Adorsys member might help with not assigned issues.
     - Compared with issues on M/S#1 and M/S#2, issues on this milestone seems to be relatively easy
       because there is the document for Client Policies 
       (Client Policies Practical Guide : https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-oauth-sig/blob/master/FAPI-SIG/documents/ClientPolicies/ClientPoliciesPracticalGuide.pdf) .
     - keycloak development team will review the PRs currently waiting for review and PRs that will be sent afterwards.

 * Other Topics of Client Policy Official Support
   - Built-in Default Client Policies is deferred due to a lack of manpower.
   - Client Registration Policies Migration is deferred due to a lack of manpower.

 * Next Web Meeting
