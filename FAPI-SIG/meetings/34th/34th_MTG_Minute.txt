Summary :

 * Automated conformance test environment for Australia CDR
   Due to the contribution by Australia's contributor, it has been supported by the current FAPI-SIG's automated conformance test environment.
   It was confirmed that both Keycloak 17 and Keycloak 15.0.2 can pass conformance tests of both AU-CDR Adv. OP w/ Private Key, and AU-CDR Adv. OP w/ Private Key, PAR comformance profiles.

 * OID-F Certificate for Australia CDR
   Keycloak 15.0.2 may achive a certificate for Australia CDR of both AU-CDR Adv. OP w/ Private Key, and AU-CDR Adv. OP w/ Private Key, PAR comformance profiles.
   Keycloak 15.0.2 has already achieved FAPI 1.0 Advanced, FAPI-CIBA, and Open Banking Braliz FAPI 1.0.

 * Keycloak 18
   Keycloak 18 may be released after Easter.

 * OIDC Certificate 
   Keycloak will re-acquire OIDC OP certificate for the following conformance profile:
   - Config OP
   - Basic OP
   - Implicit OP
   - Hybrid OP
   - Dynamic OP
   - FORM POST OP
   Currently, the remaining 3rd Party-Init OP conformance profile is out of scope.
   
 * OIDC Certificate for logout profiles
   Keycloak will newly acquire OIDC OP certificate for the following conformance profile:
   - RP-Initiated OP
   - Session OP
   - Front-Channel OP	
   - Back-Channel OP
   Due to the following issue, those are conducted by statically registered clients.
   https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/10135
   However, this matter does not affect achieving a certificate.

 * Keycloak's original features affected by deprecating client adapters
   If client adapters are deprecated, not sure how keycloak's original features (eg. Autorization Service without permission ticket, pushing not before policy, backchannel logout) would be treated.
   This matter will be discussed in github discussion of Keycloak's repository.

 * Next Web Meeting
   Wed 4 May 2022 12:00 - 13:00 UTC in 1 hour
