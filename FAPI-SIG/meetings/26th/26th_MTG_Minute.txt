Summary :

 * release
   keycloak 15.0.2 is released.

 * proposal : new working items
  - PII returned from Token Introspection Endpoint

 * Other Discussion Topics
   - RH-SSO 7.5 might be based on keycloak 15.0.2.
   - For the proposal, it might be beneficial if we want to hide some sensitive information that should not be revealed to a client.
   - For the proposal, it can be accomplished by encrypting an access token including PII or other sensitive information that should not be revealed to client by a resource server's public key in JWE.
   - For the proposal, perhaps it can be accomplished by newly introduced Token Exchange SPI from keycloak 15.
