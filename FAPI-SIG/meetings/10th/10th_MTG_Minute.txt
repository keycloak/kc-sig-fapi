 * Other Discussion Topics
   - Adapting FAPI-RW to PSD2
     It is difficult to adapt FAPI-RW security profile to PSD2 requirements, especially The Berlin Group's implementation NextGen PSD2.
     Currently, The Berlin Group considers the design for how to adapt FAPI-RW security profile to PSD2 requirements.
     It needs help with review of this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e5M5aLgNgiu4kkPIt3BjSHBt2mZL9DkcQ7bfL4Zqdgw/edit
     The main point that PSD2 covers but FAPI-RW does not cover is Consent Management. However, FAPI-WG of OID-F also discusses Consent/Grant Management on https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/276/consent-management-in-fapi
   - Using keycloak for PSD2
     The major problem that arises when using keycloak for PSD2 is treating dynamic scopes (including consent_id) because the scope must be registered in advance on keycloak.
     As its workaround, the custom authenticator (provider) could treat it.
   - DPoP support contribution
     Backbase plans DPoP support contribution.
   - Features being tech preview might block business
     In some case, when using keycloak/RH-SSO on business (e.g. financial industry), it might be problem if the needed feature is tech preview.
     keycloak's FAPI-RW security support relies on Client Policy that is treated as tech preview for a while, which means that FAPI-RW support is considered to be also tech preview.
   - CIBA PR review help
     The review of the CIBA PR takes a lot of time. It might be helpful if FAPI-SIG members could help to review the CIBA PR.
