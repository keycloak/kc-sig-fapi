   Presentation materials in Keycloak 23 can be posted to https://github.com/keycloak/kc-sig-fapi/tree/main/KeyConf/Keyconf%2023

 * Examples and demos for security features
   These are useful when we demonstrate Keycloak's security features to clients and present them in conferences.
   Contributions of these examples and demos are welcomed, but we did not determine where these are contributed (e.g., OAuth SIG's repository).
