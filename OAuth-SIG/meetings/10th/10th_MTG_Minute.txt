Summary :

 * OID4VCI
   Epic issue: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/25936
   6 issues of 9 issues in total were resolved (2 issues were newly resolved). 1 PR was newly submitted and its review is ongoing.
   https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/27931

   In 2026, viable use cases might come due to registration like eIDAS 2.0.
   In USA, a mobile driver license (ISO mdoc format) has been actually used.
   In Europe, SD-JWT is also mandate.

   The existing OID4VIC implementation : Microsoft Entra

 * Token Excnahge
   The following discussion gathers use-cases of Token Exchange.
   https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/26502
   A lot of people in some community events like KubeCon EU want Token Exchange to be out of preview feature.

   Current Keycloak Token Exchange depends on Fine-grained Permission which is still prevew feature.
   Therefore, it might be good to decouple Token Exchange with Fine-grained Permission.
   However, its alternative of some authorization mechanism for doing token exchange is needed.
   
 * Community event proposal: Keyconf 24
   Other Keycloak community 1st event was held on Vienna, Austria on March 19, 2024.
   https://www.meetup.com/keycloak-user-group-austria/
   2nd event will be held on June 12, 2024.
   3rd event will be held on November 6, 2024.

   Vienna is close to Brno, Czech Republic, where a lot of Keycloak maintainers live.
   Therefore, it is easy for them to participate in the conference if it would be held on Vienna.

   we will continue discussing this matter.
   It might be good if we would vote for the candidate (in slack?).
