Summary :

 * OID4VCI
   Epic issue: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/25936
   We consider applying the following to OID4VCI support:
    How to determine wichi VC is issued: Scope-based
    When we define the credentials: per realm
    One client can support both OIDC and OID4VC.
   To distinguish a client for OIDC or OID4VC, Client Type might be used.
   Client Type:
     Keycloak 25 supports it as an EXPERIMENTAL feature.
     Discussion: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/8497
     Epic issue for all three milestones: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/22263
     Epic issue for milestone 1: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/22262

 * DPoP
   Epic issue: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/22311
   2 of 4 issues were resolved (+1 issue added).
   The OIDF's conformance suite start supporting conformance tests with DPoP.
   A new issue was created to check whether Keycloak can pass these confomance tests.
   https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/31970
   However, we need to implement a resource server for the conformance test that supports DPoP.
   The resource server has not yet been developed, so the conformance test with DPoP cannot be executed against keycloak.

 * Community event proposal: KeyConf 25
   Two options, CNCF KubeCon co-located event or Standalone event (like KeyConf 24). The former requirest at least three sponsors (9,500 USD as a gold sponsor).
   We determine which option we take in KeyConf 24 Vienna.
