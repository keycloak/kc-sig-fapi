Summary :

 * OID4VCI
   Epic issue: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/25936
   23 out of all 25 issues were resolved. (+3 new issues, +2 resolved).
   We need to OID4VCI spec changes because it is still an implementer's draft.
   As for VC format, we now put focus on IETF SD-JWT VC because EUDI Wallet's Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) requires it.
   The next focus might be ISO mDL.

   1 out of all 8 issues were resolved. (+8 new issues, +1 resolved)

   We continue discussing this topic in breakout sessions.

   Epic issue: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/22311
   2 of 3 issues were resolved (+2 issues resolved).
   The gap between current Keycloak's DPoP support and DPoP spec need to be analyzed. 
   We continue discussing this topic in breakout sessions.
   The OIDF's conformance suite start supporting conformance tests with DPoP.
   A new issue was created to check whether Keycloak can pass these confomance tests.
