Summary :

 * Lightweight Token
   Epic topic: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/21186
   The core issue was resolved. Keycloak supported Lightweight Token.
   Two related tasks are newly added:
    [1] Enhance error logs and error events during UserInfo endpoint and Token Introspection failure
    https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/24344
    https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/24346
    [2] Look if checks in IntrospectionEndpoint can be simplified
    https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/24466

 * Passkeys
   Keycloak supported passkey authentication by utilizing WebAuthn, but it is treated as Technology Preview.

 * OID4VCI
   Discussion: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/pull/351
   The 2nd breakout meeting would be planned to discuss the topic.
   Also continue its discussion in CNCF keycloak's slack or feedback comments on the discussion.
   The three point we need to notice when using FIWARE's implementation on OID4VCI that imports walt.id's package:
     waltid-ssikit : https://github.com/walt-id/waltid-ssikit
   [1] Acceptability
       Is it acceptable to keycloak?
       Keycloak tends to avoid including external packages (maybe to reduce maintainance costs for these packages)
   [2] Licence Compatibility
       It might be no problem, but not 100% sure:
       keycloak : Apache License 2.0
       waltid-ssikit : Apache License 2.0
   [3] Technology
       The walt.id's library is written in Kotlin, which can be run on JVM.
       Not sure whether maintainers are familier with Kotlin to understand and  maintain the library.
   [4] Avaiablity
       Could we use full features of the walt.is's library without any costs and contract?
       (some open source need to make contract with its vendor if users want to use full features of the open source.)

 * Token Exchange - What could we do to move its status of technology preview to official supported
   Pedro, the keycloak maintainer needs to be included in this discussion. However, he might have little time to deal with this topic now.
   A breakout session for this topic is ideal.
   One related tasks is newly added:
    [1] Scope parameter in Oauth 2.0 token exchange
      https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/21578
      https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/21638

 * Best current practice on customizing Admin Console
   The following might be helpful:
     https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/js/CODING_GUIDELINES.md

 * Solid-OIDC
   https://solid.github.io/solid-oidc/
   PoC implementation: https://github.com/CarrettiPro/keycloak-solid/
   It might be good if it can be implemented as pluggable client profiles like FAPI.
   - Token Format - JSON-LD or pure JSON?
     Solid-OIDC uses JSON-LD, but pure JSON is also OK in Solid community.
     Candidate library for JSON-LD : Titanium JSON-LD 1.1 Processor & API
       https://github.com/filip26/titanium-json-ld
       Apache License 2.0
     SD-JWT VC also adopted JSON-LD, so JSON-LD might be preferable for OID4VCI support work.

 * OAuth 2.0 Grant Type SPI
   Codes for the current keycloak's token endpoint exceeds 1k LoC, which may cause difficulties about its maintainance and customization.
   Moreover, it covers 8 grant types.
   It is better to support each grant by a SPI provider instead of a single endpoint class.
   By doing so, use-case specific tweaking customization on existing grant could become easy.

 * Ideas for slides for OAth-SIG meetings
   Current format : power point
   Proposal :
    google slides (Prezi?)
    Reveal.JS (Impress.JS + github)

 * Next Web Meeting
   Wed 6 December 2023 12:00 - 13:00 UTC in 1 hour
