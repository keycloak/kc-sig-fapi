Summary :

 * SD-JWT support
   Walt.it might have an SD JWT lib. Need to clarify whether walt.it supports SD-JWT (by FIWARE's side?).

 * OID4VCI Keycloak integration
   Stefan updated keycloak integration with FIWARE/keycloak-vc-issuer .
     https://github.com/wistefan/keycloak/tree/add-vci
   Hitachi evaluated FIWARE/keycloak-vc-issuer and tries to modify it to support a VC issurance by Authorization Code flow by the end of Dec.

 * SIOPv2
   Paul tries to implement a SIOPv2 with Keycloak.

 * Working repository
   We use Stefan's forked repository for sharing our work:
     https://github.com/wistefan/keycloak
   It would be nice to directly push the work into the Keycloak upstream step by step.

 * OAuth 2.0 Grant Type SPI
   Dmitry tries to support each grant by a SPI provider instead of a single endpoint class. Hope for some preview in Feb. 24
   By doing so, use-case specific tweaking customization on existing grant could become easy.

 * 1st stage of GAIN POC Credential Exchange Profile

 * Next Web Meeting (planned)
   Wed 13 December 2023 12:00 - 13:00 UTC in 1 hour
