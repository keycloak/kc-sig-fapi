Summary :

 * Discussion
   We discuss issues in [Keycloak's discussion tab](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions).
   We add "area/oid4vc" label for the issues.

 * Work in Hitachi
 	The summary of the work is as follows:
	- Only modified FIWAREâ€™s extension. (https://github.com/FIWARE/keycloak-vc-issuer)
	- Supported Authorization Code Flow for OID4VCI.
	- Used static scopes (ex. response_type=code&scope= types_packetdeliveryservice format_jwt_vc_json& ... )
	- Authenticated a user registered in Keycloak and put their information onto a VC instead of using DID.
	- Defined and used several custom VC types.
	- Demonstrated issuing a VC by using VCWallet, Walt.id sever, and Keycloak with customized keycloak-vc-issuer.
	We would like to contribute our work as follows:
	- clone and checkout a branch https://github.com/wistefan/keycloak/tree/add-vci
	- port codes of our customized keycloak-vc-issuer to the branch.
	- push the PR.

 * Package naming
   We discussed how to name packages and continue discussing it.
   Discussion: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/25536

 * EdDSA
   Some Verifiable Credential (VC) data formats (vcdm, jwt-vc) requre Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA).
   Discussion: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/25536
   Supporting EdDSA is in progress.
   PR: https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/pull/17215

 * OAuth 2.0 Grant Type SPI (Discussed in 5th OAuth SIG meeting)
   It is better to support each grant by a SPI provider instead of a single endpoint class.
   Dmitry is working on it.
   Branch: https://github.com/CarrettiPro/keycloak/tree/feature/OAuth2.0-Grant-Type-SPI
